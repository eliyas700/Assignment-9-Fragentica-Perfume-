But if the perfume formulation feels a bit too synthetic or alcohol-y I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you try the fragrance oil roller ball.",

      "comment": "This smells so comforting, very vintage but it's so pretty. It's a happy upbeat scent. Powdery rose, sometimes it has a hint of fresh laundry too, but overall maybe because of the lilac or musk, there's a vintage lipstick scent base in this that I absolutely love. Transports you to the 80s or 90s, so Im surprised this was from 1947. I wish I could buy a fresh new bottle of this",
